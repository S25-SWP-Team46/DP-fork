### Tech Stack

This project uses Django (Python) for the backend, providing RESTful APIs and database management. The frontend is built with React and Ant Design for a modern, responsive user interface. PostgreSQL is the primary database, with support for other engines like MySQL, SQLite, MongoDB, and Chroma. The stack enables robust template management, user authentication, and flexible database operations. Docker is used for containerization and deployment.
